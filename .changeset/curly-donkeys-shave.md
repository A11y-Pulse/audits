Make `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor` the single home for the browser primitives that `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator` had forked: `BrowserAdaptor`, `ElementRef`, `Rect`, `PuppeteerAdaptor`, `bufferedClip`, `getSelector` and `truncateHtml`. The copies were byte-identical and had already started to drift.

`BrowserAdaptor` gains the `scale` parameter and optional `screenshotClipScale` that `ReflowAuditAdaptor` and `TextSpacingAuditAdaptor` already had, and the shared `PuppeteerAdaptor` picks up the fork's `screenshotClipScale = 2`, `optimizeForSpeed` and `clip.scale`.

**Breaking:** `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator` no longer exports `BrowserAdaptor`, `ElementRef`, `Rect`, `bufferedClip`, `getSelector`, `truncateHtml` or `TruncateHtmlOptions`, and its `./puppeteer` subpath is gone. Import them from `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor` (or `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor/dom` for `getSelector` and `truncateHtml`), and add that package to your dependencies. The tab-orchestrator no longer declares `puppeteer` as a peer dependency, since it ships no adaptor of its own.

**Breaking:** `BrowserAdaptor` requires `pressEnter`, which the tab-orchestrator's fork did not declare. The bundled adaptors already implement it; a hand-written adaptor passed to `createTabOrchestrator` needs to add it, even though the tab loop itself never presses Enter.

The audit packages re-export the same type names as before, so `FocusAppearanceAuditAdaptor` and friends are unchanged for their callers.
