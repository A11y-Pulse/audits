# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#29](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/29) [`027a314`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/027a3149f74867f0390b63447cd29377dd099662) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - `ReflowOffender` now includes an optional `screenshot` (PNG bytes), a clipped shot of the offending element captured at the 320px measurement viewport before it's restored. `ReflowAuditAdaptor` gains a required `screenshotClip` method. `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor` gains a `bufferedClip` export (padded-clip geometry, ported from `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator`'s implementation) that `reflow-audit` and `text-spacing-audit` both use for this.
  
  Capture is bounded: at most `screenshotLimit` (default 10) offenders are screenshotted per audit, since each is a real `page.screenshot()` call.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/20) [`dd1fa04`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/dd1fa043ce9ae83a20d292c0336e4036d71ae0cc) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Add `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor` with shared `BrowserAdaptor`, `PuppeteerAdaptor`, and DOM helpers. Point `@a11y-pulse/focus-appearance-audit` at the workspace package and re-export the public adaptor types for back-compat.
