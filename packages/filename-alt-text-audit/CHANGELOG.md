# @a11y-pulse/filename-alt-text-audit

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#97](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/97) [`dc533e7`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/dc533e7e3914534a080a7420dd04d4bbfd1de9e5) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Screenshot failed skip links and flagged image alt text.
  
  - `@a11y-pulse/skip-link-audit`: a failed skip link gets a `screenshot` of the link while focused. `SkipLinkAuditAdaptor` now requires `screenshotClip`; the bundled Puppeteer and Playwright adaptors already provide it.
  - `@a11y-pulse/filename-alt-text-audit`: listed `failed` and `needsReview` images get a `screenshot`, up to the new `screenshotLimit` option (default 10, `failed` first). Each image is scrolled into view, and a lazy image is loaded before capture. The page's scroll position is restored afterwards.
  - `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor`: add `captureElementScreenshot` and `stashedElementHandle`. The page scripts behind them (`pageDimensionsScript`, `elementRectScript`, `needsCentringScript`, `scrollToCenterScript`) move here from `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator`, which still re-exports them.
  - `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator`: centring an element before a capture now measures the viewport correctly on quirks-mode pages, where it previously measured the whole document and could capture a blank region.
  - `@a11y-pulse/audit-runner`: attach the screenshots as `skip-link-activation-evidence` and `filename-alt-text-evidence`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#92](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/92) [`28daa31`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/28daa3169795e628f37ae9cdadd2cc5578edb319) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Add `@a11y-pulse/filename-alt-text-audit`, which flags image alt text that is not a text alternative (WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content, failure F30). Alt text that is the full filename of one of the image's own sources is a failure; alt text that only resembles a filename, a camera file name or placeholder text in the page's language or English is reported for review. The audit runner reports it as `filename-alt-text`: own filenames in `violations`, everything else in `incomplete`.
