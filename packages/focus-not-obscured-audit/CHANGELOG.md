# @a11y-pulse/focus-not-obscured-audit

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/44) [`94c45ef`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/94c45ef081b9dde56a0b0d11eff4a6e303c93d2b) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Add `@a11y-pulse/audit-runner`, a worked example that runs every audit against a page and ships an `npx @a11y-pulse/audit-runner [url]` CLI that outputs JSON results.
  
  Each audit package now also declares a `source` export condition, matching `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator`, so cross-package typechecking resolves to source and no longer depends on workspace build order.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#29](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/29) [`027a314`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/027a3149f74867f0390b63447cd29377dd099662) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - `FocusNotObscuredElementResult` now includes an optional `screenshot` (PNG bytes) for any element whose bucket isn't `"pass"`, using the tab-orchestrator's new `screenshot` capability. Bounded by a new `screenshotLimit` option (default 10), since each capture is a real `page.screenshot()` call.
