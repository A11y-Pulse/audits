### Patch Changes

- [#52](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/52) [`3797dfc`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/3797dfc4e2d68942fff8019683db80c6a660bd04) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Document which browser engines each audit is verified against, and point the adaptor docs at `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor`, which now owns both the `BrowserAdaptor` interface and the bundled Puppeteer and Playwright implementations.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/44) [`94c45ef`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/94c45ef081b9dde56a0b0d11eff4a6e303c93d2b) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Add `@a11y-pulse/audit-runner`, a worked example that runs every audit against a page and ships an `npx @a11y-pulse/audit-runner [url]` CLI that outputs JSON results.
  
  Each audit package now also declares a `source` export condition, matching `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator`, so cross-package typechecking resolves to source and no longer depends on workspace build order.
