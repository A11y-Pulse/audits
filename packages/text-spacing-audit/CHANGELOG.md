# Changelog

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#52](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/52) [`3797dfc`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/3797dfc4e2d68942fff8019683db80c6a660bd04) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Add a Playwright adaptor alongside the Puppeteer one, exported from `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor/playwright` and from the reflow and text-spacing packages' own `./playwright` subpaths. `playwright-core` is an optional peer dependency, so Puppeteer users are unaffected.
  
  Two behaviours differ from Puppeteer and are documented in `@a11y-pulse/browser-adaptor`'s README: `evaluate` rebuilds the page function with `new Function`, which needs `unsafe-eval` in the page's CSP; and clipped screenshots go over CDP on Chromium for pixel parity, falling back to a full-page capture at the context's own `deviceScaleFactor` on Firefox and WebKit.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/44) [`94c45ef`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/94c45ef081b9dde56a0b0d11eff4a6e303c93d2b) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - Add `@a11y-pulse/audit-runner`, a worked example that runs every audit against a page and ships an `npx @a11y-pulse/audit-runner [url]` CLI that outputs JSON results.
  
  Each audit package now also declares a `source` export condition, matching `@a11y-pulse/tab-orchestrator`, so cross-package typechecking resolves to source and no longer depends on workspace build order.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#29](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/pull/29) [`027a314`](https://github.com/A11y-Pulse/audits/commit/027a3149f74867f0390b63447cd29377dd099662) Thanks [@wildlyinaccurate](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate)! - `TextSpacingElementResult` now includes an optional `screenshot` (PNG bytes): a clipped shot of the finding's element with the WCAG 1.4.12 spacing overrides still applied, captured before they're restored. `TextSpacingAuditAdaptor` gains a required `screenshotClip` method.
  
  Capture is bounded: at most `screenshotLimit` (default 10) findings are screenshotted per audit, since each is a real `page.screenshot()` call.
